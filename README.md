# DISH ORDER PROJECT

This app was created for ordering food, you just need to fill out the form and your dish will start cooking.

# Installation

You can use it here <a href="https://wlad-kryhin.github.io/dishes-project/"></a> or clone this repo and use your own hosting but don't forget about 'npm install'.

# How it works

Here is a food order form, you need to fill in all the form fields depending on the type of dish and confirm the order with the button 'submit'.
If the form is filled out correctly and the dish is available, then you will receive a confirmation of your order, otherwise it will be rejected.
Enjoy it.
